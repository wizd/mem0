title: MultiOn
---

Build personal browser agent remembers user preferences and automates web tasks. It integrates Mem0 for memory management with MultiOn for executing browser actions, enabling personalized and efficient web interactions.

## Overview

In this example, we will create a Browser based AI Agent that searches [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) for research papers relevant to user's research interests.

## Setup and Configuration

Install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install mem0ai multion
```

First, we'll import the necessary libraries and set up our configurations.

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory
from multion.client import MultiOn

# Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-xxx'  # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
MULTION_API_KEY = 'your-multion-key'  # Replace with your actual MultiOn API key
USER_ID = "deshraj"

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Initialize Mem0 and MultiOn
memory = Memory()
multion = MultiOn(api_key=MULTION_API_KEY)
```

## Add memories to Mem0

Next, we'll define our user data and add it to Mem0.

```python
# Define user data
USER_DATA = """
About me
- I'm Deshraj Yadav, Co-founder and CTO at Mem0, interested in AI and ML Infrastructure.
- Previously, I was a Senior Autopilot Engineer at Tesla, leading the AI Platform for Autopilot.
- I built EvalAI at Georgia Tech, an open-source platform for evaluating ML algorithms.
- Outside of work, I enjoy playing cricket in two leagues in the San Francisco.
"""

# Add user data to memory
memory.add(USER_DATA, user_id=USER_ID)
print("User data added to memory.")
```

## Retrieving Relevant Memories

Now, we'll define our search command and retrieve relevant memories from Mem0.

```python
# Define search command and retrieve relevant memories
command = "Find papers on arxiv that I should read based on my interests."

relevant_memories = memory.search(command, user_id=USER_ID, limit=3)
relevant_memories_text = '\n'.join(mem['text'] for mem in relevant_memories)
print(f"Relevant memories:")
print(relevant_memories_text)
```

## Browsing arXiv

Finally, we'll use MultiOn to browse arXiv based on our command and relevant memories.

```python
# Create prompt and browse arXiv
prompt = f"{command}\n My past memories: {relevant_memories_text}"
browse_result = multion.browse(cmd=prompt, url="https://arxiv.org/")
print(browse_result)
```

## Conclusion

By integrating Mem0 with MultiOn, you've created a personalized browser agent that remembers user preferences and automates web tasks. For more details and advanced usage, refer to the full [cookbook here](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/blob/main/cookbooks/mem0-multion.ipynb).
