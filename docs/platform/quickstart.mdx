## 1. Installation

Install the Mem0 Python package:

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

## 2. API Key Setup

1. Sign in to [Mem0 Platform](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys)
2. Copy your API Key from the dashboard

## 3. Instantiate Client

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

## 4. Memory Operations

Mem0 provides a simple and customizable interface for performing CRUD operations on memory.


### 4.1 Create Memories

You can create long-term and short-term memories for your users, AI Agents, etc. Here are some examples:

#### Long-term memory for a user

```python Code
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a vegetarian and I'm allergic to nuts."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted that you're a vegetarian and have a nut allergy. I'll keep this in mind for any food-related recommendations or discussions."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex")
```

#### Short-term memory for a user session

```python Code
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning a trip to Japan next month."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's exciting, Alex! A trip to Japan next month sounds wonderful. Would you like some recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Japan?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please! Especially in Tokyo."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'll remember that you're interested in vegetarian restaurants in Tokyo for your upcoming trip. I'll prepare a list for you in our next interaction."}
]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex123", session_id="trip-planning-2024")
```

#### Long-term memory for agents

```python Code
from mem0 import MemoryClient
client = MemoryClient(api_key="your-api-key")

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a personalized travel assistant. Remember user preferences and provide tailored recommendations."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood. I'll maintain personalized travel preferences for each user and provide customized recommendations based on their dietary restrictions, interests, and past interactions."}
]
client.add(messages, agent_id="travel-assistant")
```

You can monitor memory operations on the platform:

### 4.2 Search Relevant Memories

You can also get related memories for a given natural language question using our search method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
query = "What do you know about me?"
client.search(query, user_id="alex")
```

```json Output
[
    {
        "id": "7f165f7e-b411-4afe-b7e5-35789b72c4a5",
        "memory": "Name: Alex. Vegetarian. Allergic to nuts.",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a vegetarian and I'm allergic to nuts."
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted that you're a vegetarian and have a nut allergy. I'll keep this in mind for any food-related recommendations or discussions."
            }
        ],
        "user_id": "alex",
        "hash": "9ee7e1455e84d1dab700ed8749aed75a",
        "metadata": null,
        "created_at": "2024-07-20T01:30:36.275141-07:00",
        "updated_at": "2024-07-20T01:30:36.275172-07:00"
    }
]
```
</CodeGroup>

Similarly, you can search for agent memories by passing the `agent_id` argument. 

```python Code
client.search("What are the learnings from previous runs?", agent_id="travel-assistant")
```

### 4.3 Get All Memories

Fetch all memories for a user, agent, or session using the get_all() method.

#### Get all memories of an AI Agent

<CodeGroup>

```python Code
client.get_all(agent_id="travel-assistant")
```

```json Output
[
    {
        "id": "48677fae-16c4-4d57-9c27-f984f290722a",
        "memory": "Will remember personalized travel preferences for each user.",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a personalized travel assistant. Remember user preferences and provide tailored recommendations."
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Understood. I'll maintain personalized travel preferences for each user and provide customized recommendations based on their dietary restrictions, interests, and past interactions."
            }
        ],
        "agent_id": "travel-assistant",
        "hash": "644d5f40af13d0525305d8dfadc00fd1",

    }
]
```
</CodeGroup>

Get history of how a memory has changed over time

<CodeGroup>

```python Code
# Add some message to create history
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "I recently tried chicken and I loved it. I'm thinking of trying more non-vegetarian dishes.."}]
client.add(messages, user_id="alex")

# Add second message to update history
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': 'I turned vegetarian now.'})
client.add(messages, user_id="alex")

### 4.5 Delete Memory

Delete specific memory:

<CodeGroup>

```python Code
client.delete(memory_id)
```

```python Output
{'message': 'Memory deleted successfully!'}
```
</CodeGroup>


Delete all memories of a user:

<CodeGroup>

```python Code
client.delete_all(user_id="alex")
```

```python Output
{'message': 'Memories deleted successfully!'}
```
</CodeGroup>

Fun fact: You can also delete the memory using the `add()` method by passing natural language command. 

```python Code
client.add("Delete all of my food preferences", user_id="alex")
